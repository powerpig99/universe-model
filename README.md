# The Game of Life Revisited: An Indeterministic Universe

**"Reality is not a clockwork mechanism; it is the reconciliation of Indeterminism."**

This simulation is a radical departure from Conway's classic *Game of Life*. While Conway's model simulates **Determinism** (Newtonian Physics), this model simulates **Indeterminism** (Quantum Necessity). It demonstrates how structure emerges not through design, but through the tension between the Void (The One) and the Grid (The Many).

## The Philosophy

Standard cellular automata exist in a closed loop. This model exists in an **Open System**.

1.  **The Active Void (Source):** The boundary of the universe is not a wall. It is an **Event Horizon** of pure Indeterminism. It constantly injects raw potential ($+1$ and $-1$) into the system. It is the unformed "Maybe" that drives the formed "Yes/No."
2.  **Necessity:** The system is tuned to the exact mathematical edge of **Criticality**. It is the point where Chaos attempts to organize itself into Order to resolve the tension.
3.  **The Uncertainty Principle:** The state of a cell is never 100% resolved. Even in the most solid structure, there is a non-zero element of Indeterminism, allowing the system to evolve rather than freeze.

## The Logic

The state of a cell is the resolution of the conflict between its Local History (Determinism) and the Universal Potential (Indeterminism).

$$Resolution = \text{Determinism} \leftrightarrow \text{Indeterminism}$$

The logic calculates the "Horizon" where these forces meet:

*   **Determinism (The Sum):** The consensus of the neighbors.
*   **Indeterminism (The Void):** The persistent noise preventing absolute zero.
*   **The Result:** "Continents" of structure form to stabilize the Indeterminism, creating "Mass" (Memory) in a sea of "Light" (Flux).

## Running the Simulation

### Prerequisites
You need Python installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/powerpig99/universe-model.git
    cd universe-model
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Generator**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Controls
*   **Grid Size:** Modify `GRID_SIZE` in `main.py` to scale from 256 (Observer) to 1024 (God Mode).
*   **Horizon:** Modify `RADIUS` to change the scope of causality.
